## Office RestAPI
<p align = "justify">
The Office API was developed to enable companies to manage their own business better. In the application, companies are able to register employees and configurate projects with specialized teams. Managers can set new tasks for their led projects with description of what they have to do and deadlines to achieve. At the same time, employees must organize their objectives by observing deadlines and commenting on tasks for the rest of the team.

### Technologies üì±

- Java Language 17
- Spring Boot (Web, JPA, Security)
- Database with Flyway Migrations
- PostgreSQL Relational Database
- Tests with JUnit 5 and Mockito
- OAuth2 Resource Server
- JWT Token and Lombok
- Spring Validation

### Deploy ‚òÅÔ∏è
<p align = "justify">
Both the RESTful API and PostgreSQL Database was deployed using the Render services and you can already use it. Make your requests in your own HTTP CLient, like Postman for example, through the following link (https://officeapi-deploy.onrender.com). I left below a Postman collection with all the API requests, so you can test easier!

But even though the API is already deployed and hosted on Render, you steel choose to run the application on your own computer, don't worry about it, here are some instructions for you to make everything runs okay.

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
# generate public key:
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem

# copy the content into the variables
```
- DATABASE_URL
- DATABASE_USERNAME
